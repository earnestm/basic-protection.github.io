mapping basic protection of media

This was made from the leaflet tutorials on YouTube. The current choropleths are based on population data from within the geojson file but will (if possible) be altered to show percentages taken from an external csv file;

a) choropleths displaying 3 levels of risk; low(green), medium (yellow), high (red)

b) hover over tooltips/pop ups taken from a csv to show percentage of risk to basic protection for each country

Eventually it may display data from different years
